Here I analyze various coupling functions, in particular focusing on the exponential one, varying the coefficient of \phi^2 to the exponent to 
verify if there is a particular value for which we can extend minimum mass limit for scalarized solutions. 
I also checked polynomial coupling with a Z2-symmetry violating term (\phi^3 for example) to see whether the assumption of satisfying that symmetry
is strictly necessary or not for the onset of scalarized stable solutions. 

To compute the spontaneous scalarized branches of a generic coupling function see Coupling_scalarization.nb; 
when you have generated data you can check stability of the former under radial perturbation with Coupling_Stability.nb
