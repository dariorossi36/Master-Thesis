Here I analyze various coupling functions, in particular focusing on the exponential one, varying the coefficient of \phi^2 at the exponent to 
verify if there is a particular value for which we can extend minimum mass limit for scalarized solutions. 
I also checked polynomial coupling with a Z2-symmetry violating term (\phi^3 for example) to see whether the assumption of satisfying that symmetry
is strictly necessary or not for the onset of scalarized stable solutions.
