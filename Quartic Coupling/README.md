In this section we analyze a coupling function of type \\
F(\[phi])=\[eta]/8 \[phi]^2 +  \[Lambda]/16 \[phi]^4\\
that has already been studied in literature.\\
Quartic.nb is the file where we analyze spontaneous scalarization;
quartic_stability.nb the one in which we study the stability under radial perturbations of the solutions found from Quartic.nb
