perturbed_integration.nb is the file to study stability under radial perturbations of scalarized BH

equations_sGB.nb is the file where background eqautions and the perturbed ones can be generated. It was not originally created by me, but taken from article

https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.99.104041

I just modified for the Schwarzschild perturbed eq.
